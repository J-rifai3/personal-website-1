      <h2>A little about me.</h2>
      <p className="lead">
        Originally from Chattanooga, TN, my passion for rocketry and aerospace was sparked by a love for space and the unknown.
        Visiting the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during my high school years was a life-changing experience that solidified my desire to pursue a career in the aerospace industry.
<br />
<br />
        Besides that, I love to climb, play guitar and piano, lift, and hang out with friends!
